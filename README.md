twdraw
======

twdraw is a lightweight logging OpenGL 4.x drawing library that uses the core profile in a forward compatibility context. The project is in a very early stage, and will be used in a personal project (time permitting). twdraw is quite direct. twdraw provides a straightforward, cross platform interface for shader programs, vaos, and vbos, as well as state management. twdraw uses GLFW3.1 and GLEW.
